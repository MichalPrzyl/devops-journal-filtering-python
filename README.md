# Comparing filtering ways in Python
This repo is created for storing code and data for blog post in https://devops-journal.pl

# TODO
-[ ] filtering nested dicts
-[ ] what about generators while filtering strings? Why are they faster?
-[ ] structure data (json files) so everybody can use it properly

# Charts
Remember! Generator is casted to list so you lost all advantages of creating generator. It's just for chart purposes!
